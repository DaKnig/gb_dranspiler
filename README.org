* gb_recompiler

... is a tool for recompiling (non self modifying) game boy machine code to
native machine code statically. this shall provide an interface similar to a
sm83 emulator.

** Use-case

very fast cpu-only emulation of the gb can be used for unit testing and
superoptimization, among other things.

** Possible methods to achieve this

... and the pros/cons of this approach:

*** using libgccjit

pros:
- portable
- powerful optimizations

cons:
- ain't as fun as asm üòÅ
- not sure about cross function optimizations

*** x86 asm directly

pros:
- feel smart
- can keep regs outside memory

cons:
- none üòÅ

and thus for now, I will use x86 asm.

** How...

The standard System V C ABI passes the first 6 integers via the RDI, RSI,
RDX, RCX, R8, R9 registers in this order. If we map them to the gb regs, we
will eliminate the need to save the registers in ram after every routine.

the mapping I propose: (letters are sm83 regs, not hex values)
EDI : 00 _a 00 _f
ESI : 00 _b 00 _c
EDX : 00 _d 00 _e
ECX : 00 _h 00 _l
R8D : 00 00 _sp
R9  : pointer to memory array

Because of the construction, PC is known at compile time (or can be passed
over the stack, later, for compatibility with self modifying code).

The flags register is not really updated besides when it needs to be- that
is between returns. Otherwise one can use the native flags reg, some bitmask
test etc. hf, nf are hardly ever used and are hard to compute compared to
cf, zf.

Every routine/function is translated into the same function signature on
C ABI level:

typedef void (*sm83_func)(uint32_t af,
                          uint32_t bc,
                          uint32_t de,
                          uint32_t hl,
                          uint32_t sp,
                          uint8_t* mem);

any source function is gonna start with a prolog unpacking the regs into host
regs with the following mapping:

sm83 | x86
a    | al
f    | flags, ah
b    | bl
c    | r9b
d    | r8b
e    | dl
hl   | cx
sp   | di

mem  | si

hl is stored together in one register since it is commonly used as one reg
pair.

flags: the n, h are stored in ah at the beginning of the function and later
moved or used as required.

** Optimizations

An optimization pass can happen to make the code a tiny bit faster. The
following optimizations are proposed:

- code motion to pipeline code better
